\section{Introduction}
This group assignment is designed to provide foundation students with hands-on experience in front-end web development, document typesetting, and data management. Aimed at encouraging teamwork and practical skills application, students will collaborate in teams to complete tasks involving JavaScript, LaTeX, and XML.

\section{Git}

We collaboratively managed a version control repository using Git. Each of us committed regularly to documenting our progress and contributions. We included a changelog.txt file detailing each update, along with the author's name and a brief description.

\section{HTML/CSS/JS}

We designed and implemented a basic HTML web page with a form, styled with CSS, focusing on teamwork in both design and coding. Together, we ensured the web page was responsive and usable across different devices. Additionally, we developed functionality using the JavaScript Fetch API to handle data submissions, emphasizing collaborative coding and problem-solving throughout the process.

\section{LaTeX}

As a team, we created a LaTeX document that details the scope and findings of our project.

\section{XML}

As a group project, we designed an XML document to represent structured data in a detailed and organized manner. Together, we defined the structure and elements of the XML document, ensuring it is accurate and complete.

\section{Conclusion}

This group assignment provided us with practical experience in front-end web development, document typesetting, and data management. Collaborating on tasks with JavaScript, LaTeX, and XML enhanced our technical skills and teamwork. Managing a Git repository taught us the importance of documenting progress. Designing a responsive webpage and implementing JavaScript functionality improved our ability to create user-friendly applications. Creating a LaTeX document and structuring data with XML honed our attention to detail. Overall, this project equipped us with valuable skills and collaborative experience for the future.
